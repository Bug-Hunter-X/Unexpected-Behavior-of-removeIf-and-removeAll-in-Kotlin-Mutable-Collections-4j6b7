This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic difference in the behavior of Kotlin's `removeIf` and `removeAll` functions when used with mutable collections (Lists and Sets).  The core issue lies in how these functions handle the removal of elements based on a predicate.  `removeIf` modifies the collection in place, whereas `removeAll` does so more reliably across different collection types.  The provided example showcases this behavior and highlights the importance of understanding these nuances for avoiding unexpected outcomes.
