The primary solution is to understand and choose the correct method.  For consistent behavior and clarity across different collection types, prefer `removeAll`.  If a direct in-place modification of the original collection is required and the collection is a List, `removeIf` can be used.

However, for Sets, sticking with `removeAll` is advisable for consistency. To explicitly address the potential error, always use the `removeAll` function for both lists and sets.  This ensures consistent behavior and avoids potential bugs due to subtle differences in how `removeIf` operates on different collection types.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val list = mutableListOf<Int>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    list.removeAll { it % 2 == 0 }
    println(list) // Output: [1, 3, 5]

    val set = mutableSetOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    set.removeAll { it % 2 == 0 }
    println(set) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
}
```
